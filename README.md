Once the user has loaded the page, they will have the option to login under a username. 

The only way to begin playing is if you login. 

Once logged in, your button options will appear and you've now the ability to talk within the chatbox.

If the any of the three buttons are pressed, all of them will become hidden and you must now wait until the other player 
has made their choice.

The choices are then compared and  a winner is chosen and their score will reflect.

As soon as a player disconnects, the game is restarted...
