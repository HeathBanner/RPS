## RPS

RPS is a Rock Paper Scissor game that uses a real-time database. The user must first signup then login with their new account. Once logged in they will have four options. Create either a public or private lobby, or join a previously created private or public lobby. When both players have joined, they can then choose between Rock, Paper or Scissor. After the players have selected their "move", the application will then decide the winner and increment the points appropriately. 

Of course, a game isn't complete without a form of communication. To the top right will be a chat box. Users can talk to each other as they please. 

## Motivation

I wanted to better understand real-time databases and sharpen my skills with JQuery including the basics (HTML, CSS). My love for React JS also gave me the idea of training my DOM manipulation skills.
